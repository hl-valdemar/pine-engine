# Pine Engine

In honor of forests of lush pine. ðŸŒ¿

To build and run the examples, simply run `zig build <example>` (folder name) in your favorite terminal. All examples are contained in the examples folder.

Utilizes various other pine-based modules, including:

- Pine ECS: [https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs](https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs), an ECS written entirely in Zig.
- Pine Frame: [https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs](https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-frame), a cross-platform window and graphics abstraction library containing the `pine-window` and `pine-graphics` modules.
- Pine Terminal: [https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-terminal](https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-terminal), a cross-platform terminal abstraction library.

These modules are disjoint and can be used on their own.

-- Built on Zig and simple pine

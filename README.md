# Pine Engine

In honor of forests of lush pine. ðŸŒ¿

To build and run the examples, simply run `zig build <example>` in your favorite terminal. All examples lie in the examples folder.

Utilizes various other pine-based modules, including:

- Pine ECS: [https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs](https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs)
- Pine Frame: [https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-ecs](https://github.com/hl-valdemar/pine-frame)

These modules are disjoint from each other and can be used on their own.

-- Built on Zig and simple pine
